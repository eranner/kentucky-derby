Fun application that uses JavaScript's built-in Math methods to simulate dice. Numbers are generated until a horse crosses the finish line.

**How To Run:**
Simple game to run. You are prompted to pick one of the horses that you believe will win the race. Input into the form which number you want and click the "Let's Race" button

When you are ready for the game to begin, click the "Roll" button. Numbers will be generated and the horses numbers that are called move down the racetrack.
"Roll" is clickable until a horse wins the game. You will be notified which horse won.
At that point, you can click "Race Again" to run the same race or click "Next Race" to go to the a different race with different rules.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**

At this point, there is no reward for picking the correct horse. That will be added in the future.
The "William Tell Overture" is fun, but can get annoying. Will most likely give a "Mute" option in the future
Looks can definitely be improved
